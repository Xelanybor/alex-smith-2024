# Question 3: Pangram or Not

## Usage

From the project-3 directory, call:

```shell
python3 project3.py
```

The demo program will prompt you to enter a string to check if it is a pangram or not, as well as an alphabet to test it against. This can be left blank to default to using the standard english alphabet (i.e. a-z).

```shell

Enter the alphabet to check against (leave blank for English a-z):

This string is a pangram.
