def numberMachine(number: int) -> tuple[int, int, int]:
    """A number machine accepts a five-digit number and transforms it in three ways, viz:
- reverses the number. E.g. 12345 should be returned as 54321.
- calculates the sum of its digits.
- generates a new number by adding one to each of its digits. For example if the number that is input is 12391 then the output should be displayed as 23402.

    Args:
        number (int): The number to transform.

    Returns:
        int: The input number with digits reversed.
        int: The sum of the input's digits.
        int: The input number with 1 added to each of its digits.
